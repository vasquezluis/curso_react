### -> install eslint with standard for typescript
    npx eslint --init
      select standard - browser - javascript format

!!! Possible problem with eslint -> is already installed with the Vite's bundle
    Delete all node_modules folder, delete the eslintrc.cjs, delete the package-lock.json
    and the the eslint related modules in package.json file
    Then, run eslint command again

### -> configure Standard eslint for React with Typescript
    Add "project": "./tsconfig.json" in "parserOptions" in .eslintrc.cjs file
